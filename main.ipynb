       "3  Dear Wiki Community,\\n\\nMy name is Mackenzie Lemieux and I am a neuroscience researcher at the Salk\\nInstitute for Biological Studies and I am interested in exploring biases on\\nWikipedia.\\n\\nMy research hypothesis is that gender or ethnicity mediate the rate of\\nflagging and deletion of pages for women in STEM.  I hope to\\nretrospectively analyze Wikipedia's deletion history, harvest the\\nbiographical articles about scientists that have been created over the past\\nn years and then confirm the gender and ethnicity of a large sample.\\n\\nIt appears that we can identify deleted pages with Wikipedia's deletion log\\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_log>, but to actually see\\nthe page that was deleted we need to be members of one of these Wikipedia\\nuser groups:  Administrators\\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators>, Oversighters\\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Oversight>, Researchers\\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Researchers>, Ch...  \n",

      "Hi all, The next Research Showcase will be live-streamed on Wednesday, July 15, at 9:30 AM PDT/16:30 UTC. Wikipedia is one of the most important online resources for health information. This has been especially highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic: since the beginning of the year more than 5000 articles related to Covid-19 have been created receiving more than 400M pageviews. Therefore, for this month’s showcase our two invited speakers will help us get a better understanding of the state of medical knowledge in Wikipedia. In the first talk, Denise Smith will give an overview on how Wikipedia's health content is used by different audiences (public, students, or practitioners). In the second talk, Giovanni Colavizza will present results on how editors on Wikipedia find, select, and integrate scientific information on Covid-19 into Wikipedia articles. YouTube stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIV26lWrD9c As usual, you can join the conversation on IRC at #wikimedia-research. You can also watch our past research showcases here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Research/Showcase This month's presentations: Wikipedia for health information - Situating Wikipedia as a health information resource By Denise Smith (McMaster University, Health Sciences Library & Western University, Faculty of Information & Media Studies) Wikipedia is the most frequently accessed web site for health information, but the various ways users engage with Wikipedia’s health content has not been thoroughly investigated or reported. This talk will summarize the findings of a comprehensive literature review published in February. It explores all the contexts in which Wikipedia’s health content is used that have been reported in academic literature. The talk will focus on the findings reported in this paper, the potential impact of this study in health and medical librarianship, the practice of medicine, and medical or health education.    -    D.A.

PLoS ONE.    https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228786 COVID-19 research in Wikipedia By Giovanni Colavizza (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands) Wikipedia is one of the main sources of free knowledge on the Web. During the first few months of the pandemic, over 4,500 new Wikipedia pages on COVID-19 have been created and have accumulated close to 250M pageviews by early April 2020.1 At the same time, an unprecedented amount of scientific articles on COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic have been published online. Wikipedia’s contents are based on reliable sources, primarily scientific literature. Given its public function, it is crucial for Wikipedia to rely on representative and reliable scientific results, especially so in a time of crisis. We assess the coverage of COVID-19-related research in Wikipedia via citations. We find that Wikipedia editors are integrating new research at an unprecedented fast pace. While doing so, they are able to provide a largely representative coverage of COVID-19-related research. We show that all the main topics discussed in this literature are proportionally represented from Wikipedia, after accounting for article-level effects. We further use regression analyses to model citations from Wikipedia and show that, despite the pressure to keep up with novel results, Wikipedia editors rely on literature which is highly cited, widely shared on social media, and has been peer-reviewed.    -    G.
