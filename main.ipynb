Wikipedia is one of the most important online resources for health information. This has been especially highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic: since the beginning of the year more than 5000 articles related to Covid-19 have been created receiving more than 400M pageviews. Therefore, for this month’s showcase our two invited speakers will help us get a better understanding of the state of medical knowledge in Wikipedia. In the first talk, Denise Smith will give an overview on how Wikipedia's health content is used by different audiences (public, students, or practitioners). In the second talk, Giovanni Colavizza will present results on how editors on Wikipedia find, select, and integrate scientific information on Covid-19 into Wikipedia articles.

So unfortunately in this research, we are only looking for researchers and developers who are familiar with ORES. Best, Ethan  \n3  Dear Wiki Community, My name is Mackenzie Lemieux and I am a neuroscience researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and I am interested in exploring biases on Wikipedia. My research hypothesis is that gender or ethnicity mediate the rate of flagging and deletion of pages for women in STEM.  I hope to retrospectively analyze Wikipedia's deletion history, harvest the biographical articles about scientists that have been created over the past n years and then confirm the gender and ethnicity of a large sample. It appears that we can identify deleted pages with Wikipedia's deletion log <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_log>, but to actually see the page that was deleted we need to be members of one of these Wikipedia user groups:  Administrators <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators>, Oversighters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Oversight>, Researchers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Researchers>, Checkusers <https://en....  \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Hi Mackenzie, Thanks for sharing more about your research here.
