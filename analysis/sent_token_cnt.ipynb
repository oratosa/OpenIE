Or does thanking others for their voluntary efforts have little CAT Lab <https://citizensandtech.org/> has partnered with Arabic, German, Persian and Polish language Wikipedias to answer those questions - and more In a field experiment that organized experienced Wikipedians to thank we found that *receiving a Thanks increased two week retention by 2 percentage points* on average. Receiving thanks also causes recipients to send 43% more thanks on average (preprint <https://osf.io/dmwef/>). A partner study looked at the effects on senders of giving Thanks While we did not find an effect, this could be because *many** volunteers already felt emotionally drained from their efforts on Wikipedia and weren't able to complete the study*. Because of this, we made valuable discoveries about who spends time supporting others, how they think about the intentions of newcomers, and how they feel about their work.

AFD is a seven day process for articles that are expected to be contentious deletions. We have other processes that are supposed to be for less contentious subjects, I suspect that many, possibly most of the articles on academics that get deleted are via the speedy deletion process, in particular by code A7 \"no credible assertion of importance or significance\". I have seen people argue that merely being a university professor is not a credible assertion of importance or significance, and less contentiously (in Wikipedia terms) if the only claim of significance in an article is that someone is an assistant professor, then I would not be surprised if the article was deleted per A7. One problem with articles being deleted per A7 is that unless you can look at the article you usually don't know whether the article was about the academic you were inter...  \n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             As far as I know, there is no simple solution to this, especially if you want to do it for many languages. I quickly wrote up a phabricator <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T258514>) to request that WMF externally that contains the information that you would need to generate your own API (or more likely, just join into whatever data you're working with). I can't make any promises on how long this will take to produce, but if this is valuable to have in the next week or so, I can look into creating a snapshot of this data and putting it on Figshare in the meantime until there's a more sustainable solution to it.  \n27                                                                                       I recently completed a project writing en.wiki articles for all female and indigenous professors in my country, .nz. I now write pronounless biographies, because there were a significant number whose gender wasn't apparent from their public persona. My guess is that women and LGBTIA+ minorities are incentivised to remove markers of their gender from their online presence to keep a lower profile to avoid the trolls and bigots. There were also a number who clearly appeared to be a certain ethnicity based on their staff photo, but where there were no reliable sources as to that ethnicity. I also had a one person ask for their article to be deleted.

Papers due: August 10, 2020 Notification of accepted papers: September 11, 2020 Camera-ready papers due: September 21, 2020 Workshop date: October 29, 2020 Wikidata is an openly available knowledge base, hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. It can be accessed and edited by both humans and machines and acts as a common structured-data repository for several Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and Wikisource. It is used in a variety of applications by researchers and practitioners alike. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of publications around Wikidata. While there are several dedicated venues for the broader Wikidata community to meet, none of them focuses on publishing original, peer-reviewed research. This workshop fills this gap - we hope to provide a forum to build this fledgling scientific community and promote ...  \n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I've been using the Wikimapper API mentioned here: ﻿On 7/21/20, 12:39 PM, \"Wiki-research-l on behalf of Haifeng Zhang\" <wiki-research-l-bounces at lists.wikimedia.org on behalf of haifengz.suny at gmail.com> wrote:  \n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Why 2016 specifically? If by \"official\" you mean \"publicly known or announced\", you can check sources like: In general, we don't know what the censors are doing. Anomalous patterns in page views may help identify changes in censorship status, as famously done by the past study: I didn't understand what you said about geolocation. I would expect that to find anomalies you first need to aggregate raw data by some factor which is already better known that what you're looking for. Geolocation of IP address ranges by country is usually ok in most cases even with open databases, although sometimes there are blatant mistakes.  \n34  You may be correct in either or both of your hypotheses, but you might also want to check out two other related ones. 1 Some academic institutions may have an element of misogyny in their HR policies, leading to such situations as an academic becoming notable for their work to the point where they merit a Wikipedia article, before they 2 In Wikipedia's drive to address the gender skew in our content, we may have some editors creating articles on women who don't yet meet our notability criteria. Such articles are of course highly likely to be There is another way to approach this, check primary and secondary sources to see how Wikipedia compares against them. For example, we have articles on every female Fellow of the Royal Society, and we achieved that almost a decade ago. I don't know if we yet have articles on all the blokes..  I expect we have articles on every Nobel Prize Winner by now, but there will be less well known awards and lists of people in STEM.

G. de Rassenfosse <http://www.gder.info/>, we are working on an open-source project to extract, parse and consolidate worldwide Patent citations. This is PatCit, and you can learn more about it on the project GitHub <https://github.com/cverluise/PatCit> and in this short presentation <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11COlz64EZn8PipXvnDBBZI_bnDD0fpm6tyx1_EqD6lU/edit?usp=sharing> . *Patent to wiki citations* Specifically, we found ~100k wiki citations (with a large majority of wikipedia articles) stemming from worldwide patents. We have parsed these citations (item, date, url, hostname) and made the dev table publicly available on BigQuery (see fp_wiki_dev <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=npl-parsing&p=npl-parsing&d=patcit&t=fp_wiki_dev&page=table>). A short presentation of this specific work is available here <https://docs.google....  \n19  Dear All, I am happy to announce that the Research team at the Wikimedia Foundation has officially started a new Formal Collaboration [1]  with the University of Turin (Italy) on Understanding Readers' Engagement with Images in Wikipedia. Rossano Schifanella, Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Turin, will be the main formal collaborator contributing to this project. We are thankful to Rossano for agreeing to spend his time and expertise on this project in the coming year!

Or does thanking others for their voluntary efforts have little effect? CAT Lab <https://citizensandtech.org/> has partnered with Arabic, German, Persian and Polish language Wikipedias to answer those questions - and more - in two new studies. In a field experiment that organized experienced Wikipedians to thank thousands of editors <https://citizensandtech.org/2020/06/effects-of-saying-thanks-on-wikipedia/>, we found that *receiving a Thanks increased two week retention by 2 percentage points* on average. Receiving thanks also causes recipients to send 43% more thanks on average (preprint <https://osf.io/dmwef/>). A partner study looked at the effects on senders of giving Thanks <https://citizensandtech.org/2020/06/mentoring-thanking-and-burnout-wikipedia/>. While we did not find an effect, this could be because *many** volunteers already felt emotionally drained from their efforts on Wi...  \n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Hi everyone! I'm looking for some reading. I hope this is an acceptable use of this list. Which are the core Wikipedia papers, that shaped understanding Wikipedia and Wikipedia research? Which are the papers or other research that taught you the most unexpected things about Wikipedia and ran contrary to your preconceived notions about the encyclopedia? M v h, Sven  \n24   Hi everyone, We’re preparing for the July 2020 research newsletter and looking for contributors. Please take a look at https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/WRN202007 and add your name next to any paper you are interested in covering. Our target publication time is  2 August 15:59 UTC. If you can't make this deadline but would like to cover a particular paper in the subsequent issue, leave a note next to the paper's entry below. As usual, short notes and one-paragraph reviews are most welcome. Highlights from this month:       - Approaches to Understanding Indigenous Content Production on Wikipedia    - Enriching Knowledge Bases with Interesting Negative Statements       - From web to SMS: A text summarization of Wikipedia pages with character limitation       - Gender Bias in Multilingual Embeddings and Cross-Lingual Transfer       - Gender, power and emotions in the collaborative production of knowledge: A large-scale analysis of Wikipedia editor conversations       - Global gender d...  \n25  Dear MacKenzie, One other thing re those AFD logs, AFD is only one of our deletion processes, and possibly not the most important one for your purposes. AFD is a seven day process for articles that are expected to be contentious deletions. We have other processes that are supposed to be for less contentious subjects, I suspect that many, possibly most of the articles on academics that get deleted are via the speedy deletion process, in particular by code A7 \"no credible assertion of importance or significance\". I have seen people argue that merely being a university professor is not a credible assertion of importance or significance, and less contentiously (in Wikipedia terms) if the only claim of significance in an article is that someone is an assistant professor, then I would not be surprised if the article was deleted per A7. One problem with articles being deleted per A7 is that unless you can look at the article you usually don't know whether the article was about the academi...  \n26                                                                                                                                                                               Hi Haifeng, As far as I know, there is no simple solution to this, especially if you want to do it for many languages. I quickly wrote up a phabricator <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Phabricator> ticket (T258514 <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T258514>) to request that WMF externally publishes an internal table <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Edits/Wikidata_item_page_link> that contains the information that you would need to generate your own API (or more likely, just join into whatever data you're working with). I can't make any promises on how long this will take to produce, but if this is valuable to have in the next week or so, I can look into creating a snapshot of this data and putting it on Figshare in the meantime until there's a more sustainable solution to it. Best, Isaac  \n27  I recently completed a project writing en.wiki articles for all female and indigenous professors in my country, .nz. I now write pronounless biographies, because there were a significant number whose gender wasn't apparent from their public persona. My guess is that women and LGBTIA+ minorities are incentivised to remove markers of their gender from their online presence to keep a lower profile to avoid the trolls and bigots. There were also a number who clearly appeared to be a certain ethnicity based on their staff photo, but where there were no reliable sources as to that ethnicity. I also had a one person ask for their article to be deleted. [If this is of interest I can send details to you directly, but I will not post their details to a public forum and ask you refrain from this also.] I look forward to reading your experimental design taking these factors into account. cheers stuart -- ...let us be heard from red core to black sky On Fri, 10 Jul 2020 at 06:43, Mackenzie Lemi...  \n28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hi all, Are you aware of any API that maps wikidata QIDs to their article Page IDs?

It can be accessed and edited by both humans and machines and acts as a common structured-data repository for several Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and Wikisource. It is used in a variety of applications by researchers and practitioners alike. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of publications around Wikidata. While there are several dedicated venues for the broader Wikidata community to meet, none of them focuses on publishing origina...  \n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I've been using the Wikimapper API mentioned here: https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/5467/mapping-all-wikipedia-urls-to-wikidata-entity-ids   Regards,   Paul Albert ﻿On 7/21/20, 12:39 PM, \"Wiki-research-l on behalf of Haifeng Zhang\" <wiki-research-l-bounces at lists.wikimedia.org on behalf of haifengz.suny at gmail.com> wrote:     Hi all,     Are you aware of any API that maps wikidata QIDs to their article Page IDs?

Why 2016 specifically? If by \"official\" you mean \"publicly known or announced\", you can check sources like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Wikipedia In general, we don't know what the censors are doing. Anomalous patterns in page views may help identify changes in censorship status, as famously done by the past study: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:HTTPS_Transition_and_Article_Censorship https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/32741922 I didn't understand what you said about geolocation. I would expect that to find anomalies you first need to aggregate raw data by some factor which is already better known that what you're looking for. Geolocation of IP address ranges by country is usually ok in most cases even with open databases, although sometimes there are blatant mistakes...  \n34  Hi Mackenie, You may be correct in either or both of your hypotheses, but you might also want to check out two other related ones. 1 Some academic institutions may have an element of misogyny in their HR policies, leading to such situations as an academic becoming notable for their work to the point where they merit a Wikipedia article, before they become a full professor. 2 In Wikipedia's drive to address the gender skew in our content, we may have some editors creating articles on women who don't yet meet our notability criteria. Such articles are of course highly likely to be deleted. There is another way to approach this, check primary and secondary sources to see how Wikipedia compares against them. For example, we have articles on every female Fellow of the Royal Society, and we achieved that almost a decade ago. I don't know if we yet have articles on all the blokes..  I expect we have articles on every Nobel Prize Winner by now, but there will be less well known awards and ...  \n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Hello all, Hope all is well. Does anyone have or know where I can obtain information about the official blocking of Wikipedia by the government per country worldwide in Oct - Dec 2016? I am geolocating IP addresses globally in that time period and need to know where the government forbade this activity.

original peer-reviewed research.',\n 'This workshop fills this gap we hope to provide a forum to build this fledgling scientific community and promote novel work and resources that support it.',\n 'The workshop seeks original contributions that address the opportunities and challenges of creating contributing to and using a global collaborative open-domain multilingual knowledge graph such as Wikidata.',\n 'We encourage a range of submissions including novel research opinion pieces and descriptions of systems and resources which are naturally linked to Wikidata and its ecosystem or enabled by it.',\n 'What we’re less interested in are works which use Wikidata alongside or in lieu of other resources to carry out some computational task unless the work feeds back into the Wikidata ecosystem for instance by improving or commenting on some Wikidata aspect or suggesting new design features tools and practices.',\n 'We also encourage submissions on the topic of Abstract Wikipedia particularly around collaborative code management natural language generation by a community the abstract representation of knowledge and the interaction between Abstract Wikipedia and Wikidata on the one and Abstract Wikipedia and the language Wikipedias on the other side.',\n 'We welcome interdisciplinary work as well as interesting applications which shed light on the benefits of Wikidata and discuss areas of improvement.',\n 'The workshop is planned as an interactive half-day event in which most of the time will be dedicated to discussions and exchange rather than frontal presentations.',\n 'For this reason all accepted papers will be presented in short talks and accompanied by a poster.',\n 'We are considering online options in response to ongoing challenges such as travel restrictions and the recent Covid-19 pandemic.',\n ' Topics Topics of submissions include but are not limited to Data quality and vandalism detection in Wikidata Referencing in Wikidata Anomaly bias or novelty detection in Wikidata Algorithms for aligning Wikidata with other knowledge graphs The Semantic Web and Wikidata Community interaction in Wikidata Multilingual aspects in Wikidata Machine learning approaches to improve data quality in Wikidata Tools bots and datasets for improving or evaluating Wikidata Participation diversity and inclusivity aspects in the Wikidata ecosystem Human-bot interaction Managing knowledge evolution in Wikidata Abstract Wikipedia Submission guidelines We welcome the following types of contributions Full research paper Novel research contributions
