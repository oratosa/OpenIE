G. de Rassenfosse <http://www.gder.info/>, we are working on an open-source project to extract, parse and consolidate worldwide Patent citations. This is PatCit, and you can learn more about it on the project GitHub <https://github.com/cverluise/PatCit> and in this short presentation <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11COlz64EZn8PipXvnDBBZI_bnDD0fpm6tyx1_EqD6lU/edit?usp=sharing> . *Patent to wiki citations* Specifically, we found ~100k wiki citations (with a large majority of wikipedia articles) stemming from worldwide patents. We have parsed these citations (item, date, url, hostname) and made the dev table publicly available on BigQuery (see fp_wiki_dev <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=npl-parsing&p=npl-parsing&d=patcit&t=fp_wiki_dev&page=table>).

Rossano Schifanella, Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Turin, will be the main formal collaborator contributing to this project. We are thankful to Rossano for agreeing to spend his time and expertise on this project in the coming year! We aim to keep the research documentation for this project in the corresponding research page on meta [2], which will link to a Phabricator task capturing research updates. I will be the point of contact for this research in the Wikimedia Foundation. Please feel free to reach out  if you have comments or questions about the research!

Or does thanking others for their voluntary efforts have little effect?

AFD is a seven day process for articles that are expected to be contentious deletions. We have other processes that are supposed to be for less contentious subjects, I suspect that many, possibly most of the articles on academics that get deleted are via the speedy deletion process, in particular by code A7 \"no credible assertion of importance or significance\". I have seen people argue that merely being a university professor is not a credible assertion of importance or significance, and less contentiously (in Wikipedia terms) if the only claim of significance in an article is that someone is an assistant professor, then I would not be surprised if the article was deleted per A7. One problem with articles being deleted per A7 is that unless you can look at the article you usually don't know whether the article was about the academi...  \n26                                                                                                                                                                               Hi Haifeng, As far as I know, there is no simple solution to this, especially if you want to do it for many languages. I quickly wrote up a phabricator <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Phabricator> ticket (T258514 <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T258514>) to request that WMF externally publishes an internal table <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Edits/Wikidata_item_page_link> that contains the information that you would need to generate your own API (or more likely, just join into whatever data you're working with). I can't make any promises on how long this will take to produce, but if this is valuable to have in the next week or so, I can look into creating a snapshot of this data and putting it on Figshare in the meantime until there's a more sustainable solution to it. Best, Isaac  \n27  I recently completed a project writing en.wiki articles for all female and indigenous professors in my country, .nz. I now write pronounless biographies, because there were a significant number whose gender wasn't apparent from their public persona. My guess is that women and LGBTIA+ minorities are incentivised to remove markers of their gender from their online presence to keep a lower profile to avoid the trolls and bigots. There were also a number who clearly appeared to be a certain ethnicity based on their staff photo, but where there were no reliable sources as to that ethnicity. I also had a one person ask for their article to be deleted. [If this is of interest I can send details to you directly, but I will not post their details to a public forum and ask you refrain from this also.] I look forward to reading your experimental design taking these factors into account. cheers stuart -- On Fri, 10 Jul 2020 at 06:43, Mackenzie Lemieux <mackenzie.lemieux at gmail.com> wrote: > ...  \n28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hi all, Are you aware of any API that maps wikidata QIDs to their article Page IDs?

It can be accessed and edited by both humans and machines and acts as a common structured-data repository for several Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and Wikisource. It is used in a variety of applications by researchers and practitioners alike. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of publications around Wikidata. While there are several dedicated venues for the broader Wikidata community to meet, none of them focuses on publishing original, peer-reviewed research.

If by \"official\" you mean \"publicly known or announced\", you can check sources like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Wikipedia In general, we don't know what the censors are doing. Anomalous patterns in page views may help identify changes in censorship status, as famously done by the past study: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:HTTPS_Transition_and_Article_Censorship https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/32741922 I didn't understand what you said about geolocation. I would expect that to find anomalies you first need to aggregate raw data by some factor which is already better known that what you're looking for. Geolocation of IP address ranges by country is usually ok in most cases even with open databases, although sometimes there are blatant mistakes. Federico  \n34  Hi Mackenie, You may be correct in either or both of your hypotheses, but you might also want to check out two other related ones. 1 Some academic institutions may have an element of misogyny in their HR policies, leading to such situations as an academic becoming notable for their work to the point where they merit a Wikipedia article, before they become a full professor. 2 In Wikipedia's drive to address the gender skew in our content, we may have some editors creating articles on women who don't yet meet our notability criteria. Such articles are of course highly likely to be deleted. There is another way to approach this, check primary and secondary sources to see how Wikipedia compares against them. For example, we have articles on every female Fellow of the Royal Society, and we achieved that almost a decade ago. I don't know if we yet have articles on all the blokes..  I expect we have articles on every Nobel Prize Winner by now, but there will be less well known awards and ...  \n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hello all, Hope all is well.

global, collaborative, open-domain, multilingual knowledge graph such as Wikidata.',\n 'We encourage a range of submissions, including novel research, opinion pieces, and descriptions of systems and resources, which are naturally linked to Wikidata and its ecosystem, or enabled by it.',\n 'What we’re less interested in are works which use Wikidata alongside or in lieu of other resources to carry out some computational task - unless the work feeds back into the Wikidata ecosystem, for instance by improving or commenting on some Wikidata aspect, or suggesting new design features, tools and practices.',\n 'We also encourage submissions on the topic of Abstract Wikipedia, particularly around collaborative code management, natural language generation by a community, the abstract representation of knowledge, and the interaction between Abstract Wikipedia and Wikidata on the one, and Abstract Wikipedia and the language Wikipedias on the other side.',\n 'We welcome interdisciplinary work, as well as interesting applications which shed light on the benefits of Wikidata and discuss areas of improvement.',\n 'The workshop is planned as an interactive half-day event, in which most of the time will be dedicated to discussions and exchange rather than frontal presentations.',\n 'For this reason, all accepted papers will be presented in short talks and accompanied by a poster.',\n 'We are considering online options in response to ongoing challenges such as travel restrictions and the recent Covid-19 pandemic.',\n '== Topics == Topics of submissions include, but are not limited to: - Data quality and vandalism detection in Wikidata - Referencing in Wikidata - Anomaly, bias, or novelty detection in Wikidata - Algorithms for aligning Wikidata with other knowledge graphs - The Semantic Web and Wikidata - Community interaction in Wikidata - Multilingual aspects in Wikidata - Machine learning approaches to improve data quality in Wikidata - Tools, bots and datasets for improving or evaluating Wikidata - Participation, diversity and inclusivity aspects in the Wikidata ecosystem - Human-bot interaction - Managing knowledge evolution in Wikidata - Abstract Wikipedia == Submission guidelines == We welcome the following types of contributions: - Full research paper: Novel research contributions (7-12 pages) - Short research paper: Novel research contributions of smaller scope than full papers (3-6 pages) - Position paper: Well-argued ideas and opinion pieces, not yet in the scope of a research contribution (6-8 pages) - Resource paper: New dataset or other resource directly relevant to Wikidata, including the publication of that resource (8-12 pages) - Demo paper: New system critically enabled by Wikidata (6-8 pages) Submissions must be as PDF or HTML, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).',\n 'For details on the LNCS style, see Springer’s Author Instructions.',\n 'The papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two researchers.',\n 'Accepted papers will be published as open access papers on CEUR (we only publish to CEUR if the authors agree to have their papers published).',\n 'Papers have to be submitted through easychair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wikidataworkshop2020 == Proceedings == The complete set of papers will be published with the
